## Prototype 4
<p><i>In this game prototype, you have to push your opponent out of the ring, but don't fall out of the ring, unless you want to take a walk in space!</i> </p>
<p>You can use the <b>‘A’</b> and <b>‘D’</b> keys <b>(or right arrow - left arrow keys)</b> to control the camera, and the  <b>‘W’</b> and  <b>‘S’</b> keys <b>(or up arrow - down arrow keys)</b> if you want to move forwards and backwards according to the camera's rotation.</p></br>
<b><i>You can also kick your opponent hard by collecting the powerup icon💥.</i></b>

## Challenge 4
<p>In the fourth challenge I solved the problems with the movement of the opponent and the player and made the opponent spawn incrementally each round.In addition to the prototype above, you can switch on turbo mode by pressing the "Space Bar" and turn the place into dust and smoke.</p>
